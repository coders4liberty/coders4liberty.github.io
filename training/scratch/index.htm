Scratch is an ideal way to start learning how to code. Instead of being bogged down with learning the syntax, you can focus on learning the structure used in programming. Also, you can learn a lot just by playing people's projects and looking inside them to see how they work. Even better, you can remix them and play with them yourself.

<h4>2.1 Introduction to Scratch</h4>

You can also use variables to make the project easier to edit later. 
	      For example, you can use variables for candidate names and make it easy for people to remix 
	      and use in the next election cycle.

<h4>2.3 Dance Party</h4>

Use motion blocks, event, and control blocks to create your own dancing animation. Build your own blocks to make it even easier to choreograph.

Programming is essentially choreography for computers. Most steps are simple. However they can become redundant, and it is easier to group steps into sets of instructions. Often these groups of commands are called functions in other programming languages.

<h4>2.4 Super Mario Lozano</h4>

This <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/185447926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario</a> parody game 
	      features Mario Lozano from the 
	      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HarrisonCountyLP/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
		      Harrison County Libertarian Party.</a> It also features music by 
	      <a href="http://reverbnation.com/thecooters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cooters</a>. 
	      Play the game like Gary Johnson campaigns, stomp on Trump and avoid touching Hillary.

You can put your custom block skills you learned in 2.3 to use and add your own levels and enemies. That’s actually what I did. 
	      The game was originally made by PaulKoning. Just click S<strong>ee Inside</strong> and click 
	      <strong>Remix</strong>.

PaulKoning made custom blocks to make making your levels easy. Just go to the block or enemy you want to add to your level and 
	      make a <strong>when I receive “next level”</strong> event and an <strong>if</strong> <span style="color:#339966;">
	      <span style="color:#ff9900;">level</span> = the level number</span> and put in <strong>createInstance</strong> 
	      blocks and specify where you want the block or enemy to appear.

For the Trumps, you can specify how far you want the Trump to wander with the third number. For the cannons, you can specify if 
	      you want them to shoot left (0) or right (1) with the third number.

You can also look at some of the later levels to see how I used loops to place multiple blocks and randomly placed blocks and 
	      enemies in some levels.

<h4><strong>2.4 Make Mine Better</strong></h4>

You may have heard the Newton quote, "If I have seen further, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."*  
	      Personally, I like the Gauss quote better, "Mathematicians stand on each other's shoulders." 
	      It's closer to reality of what drives innovation. Sometimes the giants are wrong or just not quite there yet. 
	      Sometimes a few tweaks on someone's previous work or ideas can make them that much more awesome.

Case in point, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/185446663/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make Mine Moderate
	      </a>. This project asks users to rate candidates on how liberal or conservative they are to see who is the most 
	      moderate. Can you see a problem with this project? How can you make it better? Click the Remix button and fix it. 
	      If you get stuck do not be afraid to ask the community for help. 
	      
	      <!--When you are done, add it to the 
	      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2111318/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make Mine Better</a>
